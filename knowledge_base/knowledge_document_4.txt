Score Range & Meaning:
-------------------------------------------------
0–4     → Minimal or no depression
5–9     → Mild depression
10–14   → Moderate depression
15–19   → Moderately severe depression
20–27   → Severe depression

What to Do:
-----------------------------------------------

- 5–9: Consider self-care and re-check in 2 weeks
- 10–14: Recommend behavioral activation and possibly consult with a mental health professional
- 15+: Strongly consider clinical evaluation, especially if functional impairment is high
- Any score with Question 9 > 0 (self-harm thoughts): Immediate safety concern — advise urgent professional support or crisis line
