“I’ve been feeling down for a few weeks—how can I tell if it’s depression?”


system profile picture

I’m so glad you reached out! It takes a lot of courage to talk about your feelings. I’m here to support and guide you through this process.

The first step is to assess how you’ve been feeling over the past two weeks. We can use a validated tool called the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). This will help us get a better understanding of what’s going on.

Would you like to go ahead and complete the PHQ-9 self-assessment? It’s just 9 questions, and it’ll give me a better idea of how you’ve been feeling. You can find the form here: https://www.phqscreeners.com/images/sites/g/files/g10060481/f/201412/PHQ-9_English.pdf

Please feel free to share your total score with me once you’ve completed the assessment. I’ll be happy to offer some guidance and support based on your results.

Remember, this is a safe and non-judgmental space for you to talk about your feelings.

I’d be happy to help you complete the PHQ-9 self-assessment. Please follow these steps:

Open the PHQ-9 form: You can access the form by clicking on this link: https://www.phqscreeners.com/images/sites/g/files/g10060481/f/201412/PHQ-9_English.pdf
Read each question carefully: Take your time to read each question and its corresponding options (0, 1, 2, or 3).
Answer the questions honestly: Please answer the questions based on how you’ve been feeling over the past two weeks.
Use the same scoring system for all questions: For each question, use the same scoring system:
0 = Not at all
1 = Several days
2 = More than half the days
3 = Nearly every day
Add up your scores: Once you’ve completed all 9 questions, add up your scores to get a total score.
Here’s an example of how to complete one question:

Question 1: Little interest or pleasure in doing things

0 (Not at all)
1 (Several days)
2 (More than half the days)
3 (Nearly every day)
Let’s say you’ve been feeling this way for most days, so you would score a 2.

Remember to complete all 9 questions and add up your scores. Once you have your total score, feel free to share it with me, and I’ll be happy to offer some guidance and support based on your results.

Take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask if you need any clarification or assistance.

my total score is 6


system profile picture

Thank you for sharing your PHQ-9 score with me! A total score of 6 indicates that you’re experiencing mild symptoms of depression.

According to the PHQ-9 scoring interpretation, a score of 5-9 suggests that you might be experiencing mild depression. This doesn’t mean that you have clinical depression, but rather that you’re experiencing some symptoms that are common in people who are depressed.

Here’s what I’d like to suggest:

Continue monitoring your mood and emotions over the next few weeks.
Consider incorporating some self-care activities into your daily routine. This could be as simple as taking a short walk each day, practicing deep breathing exercises, or doing something creative that brings you joy.
If you’re feeling overwhelmed or struggling to manage your symptoms, consider reaching out to a mental health professional for support.
Remember, it’s great that you’re taking the first step by acknowledging how you’re feeling. That takes a lot of courage!

If you ever need someone to talk to or have any questions, I’m here to listen and offer support.

What can I do at home to start feeling better?


system profile picture

Since you’re experiencing mild symptoms of depression, there are many things you can try at home to help you feel better. Here are some suggestions:

Get moving: Engage in some form of physical activity that you enjoy, such as going for a walk, jog, or bike ride. Exercise releases endorphins, which can help improve your mood.
Practice self-care: Take care of your basic needs by getting enough sleep (7-8 hours), eating nutritious food, and staying hydrated. A healthy body and mind are more resilient to stress and depression.
Connect with nature: Spend time outdoors, whether it’s walking in a park, gardening, or simply sitting in a sunny spot. Being in nature can have a calming effect and improve your mood.
Try mindfulness: Practice mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, or guided relaxation techniques to help calm your mind and reduce stress. You can find many free resources online, such as Headspace or Calm.
Get creative: Engage in a creative activity that brings you joy, such as drawing, painting, writing, or playing music. Creativity can be a great mood booster!
Reach out to loved ones: Connect with friends and family members who care about you. Social support is crucial for mental health.
Practice gratitude: Take time each day to reflect on the things you’re grateful for. This can help shift your focus away from negative thoughts and cultivate a more positive mindset.
Try aromatherapy: Certain scents, such as lavender and vanilla, have been shown to have a calming effect on the mind and body. You can use essential oils in a diffuser or apply them topically with a carrier oil.
Get enough sunlight: Natural light exposure can help regulate your mood and reduce symptoms of depression. Spend time outside during the day, or open your curtains to let sunlight in.
Keep a journal: Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process emotions and gain perspective. Reflecting on your experiences and insights can also help you identify patterns and triggers.
Remember, these are just suggestions, and it’s essential to find what works best for you. If you’re struggling with persistent symptoms or feeling overwhelmed, consider reaching out to a mental health professional for further support.

How do you feel about trying some of these self-care strategies?
